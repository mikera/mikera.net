# Principles

## Simplicity over complexity

Clean solutions win over clever ones. The best code is the code you can understand immediately.

## Open over closed

Knowledge should be shared and accessible. Open source isn't just about codeâ€”it's about creating value for everyone.

## Quality over speed

Take time to build things right. Technical debt accumulates faster than you think.

## Learning never stops

Every day is an opportunity to grow. The best developers are those who never stop learning.
