# The Craft of Programming

## Clean Code

Code is read far more than it's written. Write for your future self.

## Elegance

The most elegant solution is often the simplest one that works.

## Documentation

Good code documents itself, but great code includes context.

## Refactoring

Code is never finished, only abandoned. Refactoring is part of the process.
