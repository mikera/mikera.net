# Ethics in Technology

## Purpose

Technology should serve humanity, not the other way around. Every line of code has implications beyond the screen.

## Privacy

Respect user privacy. Data is powerâ€”use it responsibly.

## Accessibility

Build for everyone. The web should work for people with all abilities.

## Sustainability

Consider the environmental impact. Efficient code is green code.
